Introduction
============

- **Goal**: Learn the basics of Docker, understand images vs containers, and
  run your first custom container with runtime configurations for graphical
  applications.
- **Duration**: Around 1 hour including demonstrations.
- **Assumptions**: A Linux system (also tested on `WSL2
  <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`_), preferably Ubuntu
  24.04.

.. warning::
   Though Docker can be run on Windows and macOS as well, but their setup might
   differ and will not be covered in this workshop.

0. Motivation
=============

In modern software development and deployment, developers face several
challenges:

- **"It works on my machine" problem**

  - Applications often fail when moved from one machine to another
  - Environment inconsistencies cause bugs that are hard to reproduce

- **Complex Dependency Management**

  - Applications may depend on specific versions of Python, ROS, or system
    libraries (things installed via ``apt``)
  - Installing and updating dependencies on different machines can break
    existing setups

- **Resource Inefficiency with Virtual Machines**

  - Virtual machines (VMs) are heavy:

    - Each VM has its own operating system
    - Startup times are slow
    - Storage footprint is large (GBs per VM)

  - Running multiple VMs on a single machine quickly consumes CPU and memory

How Docker Solves These
-----------------------

- **Lightweight and Fast**

  - Containers share the host OS kernel
  - Start in seconds instead of minutes

- **Consistent and Portable**

  - The same Docker image runs everywhere: local machine, cloud, or production
    servers
  - Eliminates environment drift between developers and deployment

- **Efficient Resource Usage**

  - Containers are smaller than VMs (MBs vs GBs)
  - Multiple containers can run on the same machine with less overhead

.. note::
   Docker does **not replace** virtual machines entirely, but provides a more
   efficient and reproducible approach for most application deployments.

What does it Mean for Us?
-------------------------

- **Faster Deployment**: Applications can be deployed quickly and reliably
  across different environments.

  For example, you can setup a Mincecraft server in one command::

      docker run -d -it -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE itzg/minecraft-server

- **Reproducibility**: Ensures that the application behaves the same way in
  development, testing, and production. **What works on your machine will also
  work on the robot.**

- **Isolation**: Containers provide isolated environments for applications,
  ensuring that dependencies and configurations do not interfere with each
  other. **And when the development environment in a container is corrupted, it
  can be easily recreated by deleting the container and starting a new one.**

.. note::

   Although Docker is typically used for deploying applications, in Robot Group
   we use it to set up development environments for robotics applications such
   as `ROS <https://www.ros.org>`_, `NVIDIA Isaac Sim
   <https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim>`_ and more. As a result, the
   environment setup inside the container may differ quite a bit from the image.

1. So What Exactly is Docker?
=============================

Docker allows you to **package an application and all its dependencies** into a
single, portable unit called a **container**. This process is known as
**containerization**.

What is Containerization?
-------------------------

- **Containerization** is the process of bundling:
  
  1. Application code
  2. Runtime environment (e.g., Python, ROS)
  3. System libraries and dependencies
  4. Configuration files

- These are packaged into a **Docker image**.
- When the image is executed, Docker creates an **isolated container** that runs
  the application exactly the same on any host.

Architecture of Docker
----------------------

Docker uses a client-server architecture to manage and run containers.

   Docker Architecture

The key components in Docker are:

- **Docker Client**: The interface through which users interact with Docker.
  Which is `Docker CLI <https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker>`_
  in this workshop.
- **Docker Daemon**: The core service that runs on the host machine. It listens
  to Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers,
  networks, and volumes.
- **Docker Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers. Images are
  built using a Dockerfile and can be stored in a registry.
- **Docker Containers**: Lightweight, portable, and isolated environments
  created from Docker images. Containers share the host OS kernel but have their
  own filesystem, processes, and network stack.
- **Docker Registries**: Centralized repositories where Docker images are stored
  and shared. Docker Hub is the default public registry.

2. Docker Installation
======================

a. Install Docker Engine
------------------------

Follow the `official installation guide
<https://docs.docker.com/engine/install>`_ to install Docker Engine on your
machine. Or you can install Docker Engine using the installation script::

    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    sudo sh get-docker.sh

After installation, verify Docker is running by executing::

    docker --version

b. Post installation
--------------------

Since Docker requires root privileges, it is recommended to follow the `official
post-installation steps
<https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall>`_ to run Docker
commands without ``sudo``.

Essentially, you need to add your user to the ``docker`` group::

    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

And then apply the changes to group::

    newgrp docker

Finally, verify that you can run Docker commands without ``sudo``::

    docker run hello-world

3. Demo 1: Install ROS2 Humble via Docker
=========================================

Install ROS is as easy as running a single command::

    docker run -it osrf/ros:humble-desktop-full

This command;

1. pulls the image if not available locally
2. creates and runs a container
3. attaches an interactive terminal to the container (``-it`` flags)

After sourcing ROS2, you can varify that ROS2 is installed by running::

    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    ros2 --help

4. Working with Images and Containers
=====================================

Open another terminal, and use the following commands to manage Docker images
and containers.

1. ``docker ps`` to list running containers, it should show something like
   this::

       CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
       a6f286ce8dfe   osrf/ros:humble-desktop-full   "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes             brave_thompson

.. admonition:: Fun Fact
   :class: tip

   Notice the funny name of the container? Docker automatically generates random
   names for unnamed containers using a combination of an adjective and the
   surname of a famous person. You can actually find the list of names in
   `moby/moby repository
   <https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go>`_.

2. ``docker images`` to list available images, it should show something like
   this::

       REPOSITORY  TAG                    IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
       osrf/ros    humble-desktop-full    fd45c15db49b   2 weeks ago    3.84GB

Some other commands to manage images and containers:

- ``docker start <container_name_or_id>``: Start a stopped container
- ``docker stop <container_name_or_id>``: Stop a running container
- ``docker attach <container_name_or_id>``: Attach to a running container
- ``docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> <command>``: Run a command in a
  running container
- ``docker rm <container_name_or_id>``: Remove a stopped container
- ``docker image rm <image_tag_or_id>``: Remove an image

.. note::

   Since the container will stop once its entrypoint exits, when you exit the
   terminal by pressing ``Ctrl+D``, the container will also stop. You can
   restart it using ``docker start`` and then attach to it using
   ``docker attach``.

5. Demo 2: Create a Custom Docker Image
=======================================

I heard that ``vim`` is your favorite text editor, and you prefer ``htop`` to
monitor system resources instead of ``top``. Unfortunately, since none of these
tools are included in the ROS Docker image. Luckily, Docker allows us to
create your own custom images that include these tools so you don't have to
install them every time you start a new container.

Docker uses a file called ``Dockerfile`` to define how to build an image. This
file contains a series of instructions that Docker uses to create the image.

1. First create a new ``Dockerfile`` with the following content:

  .. literalinclude:: Dockerfile
     :language: docker
     :linenos:

2. Run ``docker build`` in the directory containing the ``Dockerfile``::

       docker build -t my-ros:humble .

   This command;

   1. Reads the ``Dockerfile`` in the current directory (`.`)
   2. Builds the image and tags it as ``my-ros:humble``

3. Verify the image is built using ``docker images``, it should show something
   like this::

       REPOSITORY  TAG                    IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
       my-ros      humble                 910d5986f63a   7 minutes ago   3.88GB
       osrf/ros    humble-desktop-full    fd45c15db49b   2 weeks ago     3.84GB

4. Finally, we can test our custom image by running a container from it::

       docker run -it my-ros:humble
  
   And you should be able to use ``vim`` and ``htop`` without installation
   inside the container.

6. Container Runtime Environment
================================

As mentioned in :ref:`workshop_docker_what_is_docker`, Docker containers are
isolated environments that run applications. The isolation includes:

- **Filesystem**: Each container has its own filesystem, which is a copy of the
  image it was created from. Changes made inside the container do not affect the
  host filesystem or other containers.
- **Processes**: Containers run their own processes, which are isolated from the
  host and other containers. This means you can run multiple instances of the
  same application without conflicts.
- **Network**: Each container has its own network stack, allowing it to have its
  own IP address and ports. Containers can communicate with each other through
  defined networks or by exposing ports to the host.
- **Environment Variables**: Containers can have their own set of environment
  variables, which can be set at runtime. This allows you to configure the
  application running inside the container without modifying the image.

And many other mechanisms to ensure the host and containers are isolated from
each other.

For example, when running ``rviz2`` in the container we just created after
sourcing ros::

    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    rviz2
  
It will not work with the following error messages::

    qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display
    qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
    This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

    Available platform plugins are: eglfs, linuxfb, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vnc, xcb.

    Aborted (core dumped)

This is because the container does not have access to the host's display server
(``X11``) by default. To run GUI applications inside a Docker container, you
need to run the container with the following command::

    # allow the container to access the host's display
    xhost +local:docker
    docker run -it \
        --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
        --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
        --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
        my-ros:humble

This command;

1. Sets appropriate environment variables (``--env`` flag), notably
   ``DISPLAY`` to the same value as the host's display.
2. Mounts the host's X11 socket into the container (``--volume`` flag),
   allowing the container to communicate with the host's display server.

Essentially, specifying this flags losens the isolation between the container
and the host. Besides mounting host's directories, you can also bind the host's
ports to the containers', or share host's GPU, etc. to suit the needs of your
application.

Finally ``rviz2`` should work as expected.

7. Demo 3: Docker Compose
=========================

But don't you think that running containers with all these options is a bit
tedious? Fortunately, Docker provides a tool called ``Docker Compose`` that
allows you to define the runtime configurations of containers using a YAML file
called ``docker-compose.yaml`` so you don't have to remember all the options
and flags.

Let's use Docker Compose to keep the configs required for running ``rviz2``.

1. Create a new file named ``docker-compose.yaml`` with the following content:

   .. literalinclude:: docker-compose.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :linenos:

2. Run the following command to start the container defined in the
   ``docker-compose.yml`` file::

       docker compose up -d

   This command;

    1. Reads the ``docker-compose.yml`` file in the current directory
    2. Creates and starts the container named ``my_ros`` defined in the file in
       detached mode (``-d`` flag)

3. Verify the container is running using ``docker ps``, it should show something
   like this::

       CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
       93e64951f4dd   my-ros:humble                  "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   3 minutes ago    Up 3 minutes             my_ros
       76780735b1d3   my-ros:humble                  "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   12 minutes ago   Up 12 minutes            wizardly_boyd
       a6f286ce8dfe   osrf/ros:humble-desktop-full   "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   21 minutes ago   Up 21 minutes            brave_thompson

4. Finally, we can test the newly created container by running::

       docker exec -it my_ros bash

   This command runs a interactive terminal in the container named ``my_ros``.
   And ``rviz2`` should work after sourcing ROS2::

       source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
       rviz2
